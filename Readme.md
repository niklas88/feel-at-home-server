# Feel@Home Server

The Feel@Home Server provides a central hub for the coordination of Feel@Home
Devices currently mainly smart lamps and wall clocks. Once a devices has been
registered with the Feel@Home Server it can be listed and controlled by clients
via a HTTP+JSON REST-like interface. This software is currently somewhat
lacking in documentation but we are eager to provide assistance for anyone
wanting to create Feel@Home Server compatible devices or clients.
